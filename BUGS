Known bugs
==========

* astrochem segfaults if the number of species is greater than
  MAX_OUTPUT_SPECIES.

* plroute returns an error if some of the formation/destruction routes
  are equal to zero.

* Some compilers (e.g. Sun Studio) rejects the __attribute__
  ((unused)) argument, so maybe we should check this with the
  configure script.
