To-do list
==========

For release 0.5:
----------------

* Fix segfault that occur if the number of species is greater than
  MAX_OUTPUT_SPECIES.

Longer-term to-dos:
-------------------

* Allocate arrays dynamically instead of limiting their size
  arbitrarily.

* Pass structures to function that have a large number of arguments.

* Move solve() to a library that can be called from other codes
  (e.g. hydrodynamics or MHD codes).

* Use MPI instead of OpenMP.

* Implement 2D geometry.

* Implement grain surface chemistry.

* Intercept convergence errors from CVODE, and exit gracefully if they
  occur.
