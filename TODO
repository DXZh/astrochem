Main to-do items
================

Items to be completed before the first release
----------------------------------------------

The following tasks need to be completed before the first
release. They are ordered by descending order of priority.

* Write a NEWS file.

Items for future releases
-------------------------

* Test different solver methods from CVODE. Some may take advantage of
  the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix.

* Allocate arrays dynamically instead of limiting their size
  arbitrarily.

* Pass structures to function that have a large number of arguments.

* Intercept convergence errors from CVODE, and exit gracefully if they
  occurs, maybe with a message that suggests how to avoid them, or
  that refer to a section in the manual.

* Implement grain surface chemistry 

Wish list or vague ideas
========================

The following items are long-term goals, or just thoughts. They are in
random order.

* Merge the 1D and 2D versions of the code.
