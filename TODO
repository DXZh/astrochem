To-do list
==========

For release 0.6:
----------------

* Pass structures to function that have a large number of arguments.

Long-term to-dos:
-----------------

* Allocate arrays dynamically instead of limiting their size
  arbitrarily.

* Move solve() to a library that can be called from other codes
  (e.g. hydrodynamics or MHD codes).

* Use MPI instead of OpenMP.

* Implement 2D geometry.

* Implement grain surface chemistry.

* Intercept convergence errors from CVODE, and exit gracefully if they
  occur.
