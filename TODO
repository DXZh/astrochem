Main to-do items
================

Items to be completed before the first release
----------------------------------------------

The following tasks need to be completed before the first
release. They are ordered by descending order of priority.

* Check the implementation of H2 formation on the grains. For now I am
  using the reaction rate from the OSU database, but I am not sure if
  this is computed correctly. I need to check the original references
  on H2 formation.

* Implement H2 and CO self-shielding.

* Write the chapter of the manual on source description, and
  proof-read the manual. The chapter on chemical networks should give
  references on how the rates are computed.  The manual should have a
  section with a list of command-line options for each program that
  come with astrochem. See:
  http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html

* Write a README file. The file should explain briefly what the code
  does, and give some succinct instructions on how to compile it. It
  should also say what its dependency are, and where they can be
  found. It should refer to the install file for more detailed
  instructions.

* Write a NEWS file.

* Emulate the rstrip function so we can use older Python version

Items for future releases
-------------------------

* Intercept convergence errors from CVODE, and exit gracefully if they
  occurs, maybe with a message that suggests how to avoid them, or
  that refer to a section in the manual.

* Test different solver methods from CVODE. Some may take advantage of
  the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix.

* Allocate arrays dynamically instead of limiting their size
  arbitrarily.

* Pass structures to function that have a large number of arguments.

* Make more self-tests.

Wish list or vague ideas
========================

The following items are long-term goals, or just thoughts. They are in
random order.

* Implement 2D (disk) geometry. The difficulty here is how to treat
  the irradiation from the star. Check references.

* Oberg et al. (2005) mention that desorption is zeroth order process,
  while it is currently modeled as a second order process in
  astrochem. How to implement this?

* Implement a sensitivity analysis. I think this can be done directly
  in CVODE. Check the manual.

* Write a program to re-order the reactions in a network to take
  advantage of the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix. See the discussion
  in Nejad et al, Astrophysics and Space Science, 299, 1-29, 2005.

* Write a program that perform some tests on a network, such as the
  value of rates at different temperature, duplicate reactions,
  un-balanced reactions, holes in the network (i.e. check that each
  specie has both a formation and a destruction route).
