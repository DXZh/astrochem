Main to-do items
================

Items to be completed before the first release
----------------------------------------------

The following tasks need to be completed before the first
release. They are ordered by descending order of priority.

* Check the implementation of H2 formation on the grains. For now I am
  using the reaction rate from the OSU database, but I am not sure if
  this is computed correctly. I need to check the original references
  on H2 formation.

* Oberg et al. (2005) mention that desorption is zeroth order process,
  while it is currently modeled as a second order process in
  astrochem. Fix this.

* Complete and proof-read the documentation manual.

* Write a README file. The file should explain briefly what the code
  does, and give some succinct instructions on how to compile it. It
  should also say what its dependency are, and where they can be
  found. It should refer to the install file for more detailed
  instructions.

* Write a NEWS file.

Items for future releases
-------------------------

* Test different solver methods from CVODE. Some may take advantage of
  the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix.

* Allocate arrays dynamically instead of limiting their size
  arbitrarily.

* Pass structures to function that have a large number of arguments.

* Intercept convergence errors from CVODE, and exit gracefully if they
  occurs, maybe with a message that suggests how to avoid them, or
  that refer to a section in the manual.

* Implement grain surface chemistry 

Wish list or vague ideas
========================

The following items are long-term goals, or just thoughts. They are in
random order.

* Merge the 1D and 2D versions of the code.
