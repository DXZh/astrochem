To-do list
==========

* Allocate arrays dynamically instead of limiting their size
  arbitrarily.

* Pass structures to function that have a large number of arguments.

* Intercept convergence errors from CVODE, and exit gracefully if they
  occur.

* Implement 2D geometry.

* Implement grain surface chemistry.
