What's new in Astrochem ?
=========================

astrochem-0.3 (February 28, 2011)
--------------------------------

* The rate for cosmic-ray desorption is now either 1) computed
  following Hasegawa & Herbst (1993) or 2) given explicitly in the
  network file (e.g. using values from Bringa & Johnson 2004).

* If the LAPACK library is installed, Astrochem can now use the
  CVLapackDense solver from SUNDIALS instead of CVDense. This results
  in a performance increase of 30% or more, depending on the LAPACK
  version.

astrochem-0.2 (January 21, 2011)
--------------------------------

* First public release
