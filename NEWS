What's new in Astrochem ?
=========================

astrochem-0.5 (not released yet)
--------------------------------

* Fixed a bug in the detection of the LAPACK library. Astrochem now
  uses LAPACK by default.

astrochem-0.4 (June 3, 2011)
----------------------------

* The main destruction/formation channels of a species plotted by
  Plroute are now ordered by their total contribution to the
  formation/destruction of that species over the time of the
  computation. An aption has been added to print the relative
  contribution of each channel.

* Fixed a bug in the computation of the main destruction routes.

astrochem-0.3 (February 28, 2011)
---------------------------------

* The rate for cosmic-ray desorption is now either 1) computed
  following Hasegawa & Herbst (1993) or 2) given explicitly in the
  network file (e.g. using values from Bringa & Johnson 2004).

* If the LAPACK library is installed, Astrochem can now use the
  CVLapackDense solver from SUNDIALS instead of CVDense. This results
  in a performance increase of 30% or more, depending on the LAPACK
  version.

astrochem-0.2 (January 21, 2011)
--------------------------------

* First public release
