Installation
============

Astrochem is written in ANSI C and should compile on most UNIX
platforms including GNU/Linux and Mac OSX.

Pre-requisites
--------------

To compile Astrochem you will need:

 1. An ANSI C-compiler (e.g. gcc, icc, etc.)

 2. The SUNDIALS (SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic
    equation Solvers) library. The library may be obtained from the
    following URL:
    
    http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/

    You will need at least version 2.4.0 of the library installed on
    your computer.

 3. Python (version 2.6 or later, but earlier than version 3.0).

 4. The NumPy and Biggles Python modules:

    http://numpy.scipy.org/
    http://biggles.sourceforge.net/

    Although they are optional, these modules are needed in order to
    use the plotting tools provided with Astrochem. Both are present
    in major Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) and in Fink or
    MacPorts on Mac OSX.

 5. To compile the documentation, you will also need PDFLaTeX and
    BibTeX.
 
Basic Installation
------------------

Astrochem follows the standard GNU installation procedure. A configure
script attempts to find on your system the C compiler, the libraries
and the programs needed to compile Astrochem and creates the
Makefiles. This script is invoked with:

  ./configure

By default, the script will look for the gcc compiler. If you want to
use another compiler, you may do so by setting the CC variable, e.g.:

  ./configure CC=icc

You may also set some compiler specific optimization options using the
CFLAGS variable:

  ./configure CC=icc CFLAGS=-O3

The script will look for the SUNDIALS library in standard directories
(/usr, /usr/local, etc.). If you have it installed in some other
place, e.g. /sw, so you can set the search path as follows:

  ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/include LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib

You can then build Astrochem by typing:

  make

A test suite is available.  After compiling the library with "make",
it can be invoked with "make check" at the top level. If you run the
tests and get some failures, please report them to
<sebastien.maret@obs.ujf-grenoble.fr>.

Astrochem can be installed using the command:

  make install

The default installation directory prefix is /usr/local.  Installing
in this directory will require root privileges on most systems (use
"su" or "sudo"). The installation directory can be changed with the
--prefix option to configure.

Optional features
-----------------

Astrochem can be run in parallel on multi CPU (or core) computers. For
this it uses OpenMP compilation directives. If your compiler supports
OpenMP, compilation of the parallel version of Astrochem can be turn
on by specifying the `--enable-openmp' option to "configure", e.g.
  
  ./configure --enable-openmp

The configure script accepts some other options.  Run "configure
--help" for more details.
